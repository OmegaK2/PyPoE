PyPoE
========
Collection of Python Tools for [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).

More detailed docs: [http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/](http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/)

The docs are occasionally updated until I get a build bot up - however docs can also be manually built with sphinx.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OmegaK2/PyPoE.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/OmegaK2/PyPoE)

Common problems & advisory
--------
* Install **Python 3.4** (on windows 86x (32 bit)) to avoid issues with the UI. Pyside support in other versions is currently not available until pyside2 is released.

Overview
--------
Parts:
* Library toolkit for programmers (PyPoE/poe)
* UI based on QT for browsing the game files
* CLI interface for extracting/exporting data (for the wiki, more TBD)

Imporant Notes
--------
Alpha Stage:
* Code structure and in particular the API may change at any time
* incomplete in many areas (check files and TODOs)
* and tests still have to be written for a lot of things.
* many functions and classes are not yet fully documentated

Dev branch:
* broken code may be committed occasionally to the dev branch

Quick Setup Guide
--------
These instructions are for the current development version of PyPoE.

* Install Python 3.4 & git
* make sure Python 3.4 and python scripts folder is in your %PATH% on windows
* checkout PyPoE with git
* go into the PyPoE folder
* Minimum install: ```pip3 install -e . ```
* Full install: ```pip3 install -e .[full]```

Usage
--------
* UI: ```pypoe_ui```
* CLI: ```pypoe_exporter``` (follow the instructions)
* API: check the individual files in PyPoE/poe/ or the docs [http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/](http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/)

--------
* [Grinding Gear Games](http://www.grindinggear.com/) - they created many of the file formats and [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) obviously, so do not reuse their files anywhere without their permission and support them if you are able :)
* [Chriskang](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/User:Chriskang) and the original [VisualGGPK2](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/User:Chriskang/VisualGGPK2)
